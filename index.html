        <p class="pcontent">Michael Lusso, Graduate of Austin Peay University in Clarskville, Tn (Class of 2000), with a
            BS in Manufacturing Engineering. I was a (4) year participant of both Cross-country, and Track. I have
            worked for Trane (3-yrs), VikingRange (6-yrs), and Hennessy Industries(12-yrs). I am currently the
            Sustaining Engineering Manager for Hennessy for the last (3) years.</p>

        <p class="pcontent">I have been married for (14-yrs), and have a wonderful daughter who will be 10 in January. I
            have coached, or assisted in coaching her softball team since she was 5. I have also played softball for
            well over 20+ years, but have since retired. My two favorite hobbies now are Golf, and driving my Jeep in
            the summer.</p>

        <p class="pcontent">I have now embarked on the mission to sharpen my saw by tackeling Full stack web
            development. I plan to use this skill to maximize, and improve my companies Manufacturing processes,
            Communication, Defect tracking and Resolution, Daily management, and Sustainment. Fortive (FTV), our Head
            company, strives for inovation, and I feel this will be a new resource to improve not only our company, but
            all the other sister companies with-in the Fortive umbrella (FTV)</p>
        <p class="pcontent">I plan on improving this web page and others as I complete the wonderful class at
            Vanderbilt's Coding BootCamp (completion date: June 1st, 2020.)
